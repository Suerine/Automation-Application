## Problem Statment
In today’s digital work environment, individuals—especially students, freelancers, and professionals—spend long hours on their computers performing tasks that are often repetitive, unorganized, and time-consuming. From constantly arranging files and juggling too many open tabs to losing track of how time is spent during the day, these small inefficiencies compound and lead to reduced productivity and digital overwhelm.

While some existing tools address parts of this problem—such as time tracking or task management—they often require technical skills, only work online, or fail to offer a comprehensive desktop-first experience. There is a clear gap in the market for a simple, intuitive solution that helps everyday users automate their workflows, stay organized, and better manage their time—all without needing to be tech-savvy.

**DeskFlow** aims to fill this gap by providing an easy-to-use desktop automation assistant that helps users track their work hours, organize their digital workspace, and schedule routine tasks—so they can spend less time on busywork and more time on what truly matters.
