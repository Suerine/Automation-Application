# DeskFlow Requirements Document
# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Project Overview
DeskFlow is a cross-platform desktop automation application designed to boost user productivity by eliminating repetitive digital tasks. It provides automation for file organization, workflow tracking, and task scheduling, enabling users to better manage their digital workspace and optimize their time.

## 1.2 Purpose
This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for DeskFlow, based on user research gathered through surveys and focus groups. It serves as a reference for development, ensuring that all user needs, technical specifications, and business goals are clearly defined before implementation begins.

## 1.3 Scope
- Desktop application for Windows and macOS.

- Targets individual users: students, freelancers, and professionals.

- Provides workflow tracking, file organization, and task scheduling features.

- Stores data locally with potential future cloud expansion.

- Intuitive, user-friendly interface with minimal technical barriers.

# 2. Stakeholder Identification
- Stakeholder	Role
- Founder / Product Owner	Project vision and direction
- End Users	Students, freelancers, professionals
- Development Team	Software engineers, designers
- UX/UI Designer	Responsible for intuitive interface design
- Data Privacy Consultant	Ensures compliance with privacy and security standards
- Testers / Beta Users	Provide feedback during development

# 3. Data Collection Summary
### Primary Research:
- Online survey (50 respondents).

- Focus group (6 university students).

### Key Findings:

- 65.3% of users spend 7–12+ hours/day on laptops.

- Top pain points: digital disorganization, distraction management, time tracking.

- Most desired feature: work hours monitoring (43 respondents prioritized this).

- Secondary features: file organization, task scheduling.

- Concerns: privacy/security, cost, ease of use.

### Secondary Research:

- Existing solutions (RescueTime, Zapier, IFTTT, Trello) do not fully cover DeskFlow’s proposed feature set.

# 4. System Overview
DeskFlow will:

- Track work hours and provide time-spent reports on apps/websites.

- Organize files automatically into folders based on predefined rules.

- Schedule repetitive tasks such as email reminders, disk cleanups, and file rotations.

- Provide a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to ensure accessibility for non-technical users.

- Store user data locally with options for future cloud sync.

# 5. Functional Requirements

ID	Description	Rationale	Acceptance Criteria
FR-01	The system shall track active screen time per app/website	Enables users to monitor workflow and productivity	User sees daily, weekly, and monthly time reports
FR-02	The system shall generate productivity reports based on usage patterns	Helps users identify time-wasting activities	Reports show categorized time spent with suggestions for improvement
FR-03	The system shall allow users to organize files into folders by name, date, subject	Simplifies file organization	Files are automatically moved to designated folders based on rules
FR-04	The system shall provide task scheduling for routine actions (emails, cleanups, log rotation)	Automates repetitive tasks	Users can create, edit, and execute scheduled tasks successfully
FR-05	The system shall provide a GUI that allows non-technical users to set up automation	Addresses learning curve concerns	Users can complete setup and configuration without using terminal commands
FR-06	The system shall allow users to customize which folders and file types to include in file organization rules	Ensures user control and flexibility	Users can easily configure organization preferences through GUI
FR-07	The system shall store data locally by default	Addresses privacy and security concerns	No data is sent to external servers by default
FR-08	The system shall allow users to export reports and logs	Enables data sharing and analysis	Reports can be exported in common formats (PDF, CSV)

6. Non-Functional Requirements
ID	Category	Description	Acceptance Criteria
NFR-01	Performance	System shall load main interface within 2 seconds	Application opens and becomes usable within 2 seconds

7. Assumptions and Constraints
Assumptions:

Users have administrative rights on their device to allow installation.

Python-based architecture can access system-level file management APIs on both Windows and macOS.

Users have basic knowledge of file systems and task scheduling needs.

Constraints:

Cloud features are excluded from initial MVP release.

Initial support for English language only.

Mac notarization and Windows signing processes must be followed for app distribution.

8. Acceptance Criteria
The application will be considered acceptable for release when:

All functional requirements (FR-01 to FR-08) are fully implemented and tested.

All non-functional requirements meet or exceed defined thresholds.

Privacy and security requirements are reviewed by a data privacy consultant.

Usability tests confirm non-technical users can successfully use the core features.

Feedback from beta testers is positive regarding usefulness and ease of use.
