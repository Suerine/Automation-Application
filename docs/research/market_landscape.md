## Market Trends & Growth Drivers

üìà Rise in remote and hybrid work has increased demand for desktop tools that reduce digital overwhelm and fight ‚Äúinfinite workday‚Äù burnout.

Gen Z and Millennials increasingly want AI and automation to handle repetitive tasks ‚Äî 62% of workers favor AI for emails/data entry.

AI + Automation is a rapidly expanding segment, with AI in remote work projected to reach ~$104B by 2033.

Demand for user-friendly, low-code/no-code tools is increasing as digital skill gaps hinder some from leveraging current tech.

Global Productivity Software Market is projected at US‚ÄØ**$81.17‚ÄØbillion in 2025**, **growing to ‚âàUS‚ÄØ$89.39‚ÄØbillion by 2030**, with a CAGR of ~1.95%

Kenya‚Äôs Productivity Software Market will reach **US‚ÄØ$35.87‚ÄØmillion in 2025, expanding at ~4.13% CAGR to US‚ÄØ$42.18‚ÄØmillion by 2029**

Demand is driven by remote work, digital overwhelm, and rising interest in automation & AI tools

## Gaps & Opportunities

Lack of a unified, desktop-first tool: current solutions either focus on time tracking, scheduling, or cloud-QA, but none combine both desktop automation and ease-of-use.

Growing digital fatigue among remote workers presents a clear need for productivity tools that reduce context-switching and digital clutter.

Demand for AI-enriched personal assistants: users want lightweight automation that respects privacy and doesn‚Äôt require coding or subscriptions to enterprise RPA.
